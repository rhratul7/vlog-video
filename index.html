            <p>Sajek Photo: Sajek was unexplored for a long time and it emerged as a tourist spot owing to it's natural
                environment.[citation needed] The place does not have modern tourist facilities and tourists visit for
                the
                nature and culture of the place.[citation needed] Though the valley is in Rangamati but to tourists
                prefer
                the route from Kagrachari to Sajek valley through Dighinala Bazaar, Bagaihat Bazaar and Machalong Haat.
